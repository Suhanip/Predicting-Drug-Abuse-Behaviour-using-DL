Going away to college is often the first time young adults are away from home for any stretch of time. Students are keen to fit in, prove themselves, and often overjoyed with their newfound freedom. These freedoms are often taken too far, however, as college campuses tend toward a higher frequency of partying and illegal drugs.

Many college administrators look the other way, thinking of binge drinking and illicit drug use as rites of passage. Fraternities and sororities are famous for episodes of hazing, which quite often include drinking and other drugs. In addition, college students may be overly worried about image, and some drugs may work as weight regulators to help combat that “Freshman 15,” even though these drugs may be harmful in other ways.

Substances commonly abused by students in college include:

Alcohol
Marijuana
Prescription medications (including stimulants, central nervous system depressants, and narcotics)
Over-the-counter drugs
Cocaine
Heroin
Ecstasy
USA Today publishes that half of the 5.4 million fulltime college students in America admit to binge drinking or using drugs at least once a month.

Alcohol on College Campuses
The most abused substance on college campuses is alcohol. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reports that four out of five college students drink alcohol. This may not seem like that big of a deal, but keep in mind that three-quarters of this population is under the legal drinking age. College students are traditionally between 18 and 22 years old, with 21 being the legal drinking age in America. Even more important, half of these drinkers engage in binge drinking, which is consuming more than three or four drinks in a sitting in an attempt to get drunk.

Many factors, in addition to its easy access, make alcohol the substance of choice for students. Upperclassmen over age 21 can buy alcohol legally and distribute it to younger students, and it is relatively inexpensive.

Some of the reasons college students drink are:

To relax
In an attempt to fit in
As a response to peer pressure
To party or have fun
As a stress reliever
To lower inhibitions
To reduce anxiety or depression
 

How Alcohol is Portrayed to College Students
Alcohol is glorified in movies, music and television. Everyone has watched movies or shows featuring college drinking parties and feats involving massive amounts of alcoholic beverages. It looks fun, and many young adults already have less impulse control or a limited perception of the consequences. Many college students can also set their schedules so they have classes only a few days a week, leaving three- and four-day weekends open for partying and recovering.

Some marketing campaigns seem to be targeting this young age as well, featuring fruity and sugary, good-tasting alcoholic beverages. Another dangerous trend popping up on college campuses is the mixing of alcohol with energy drinks for a different kind of buzz. This can be even more dangerous than the alcohol alone due to the caffeine or other stimulants found in the energy drink which can mask the depressant effect of alcohol.
While not as popular or prevalent as alcohol or marijuana, party or club drugs like cocaine, heroin, Ecstasy and LSD still have a place on college campuses as well. CASA reports that between 1993 and 2005, illegal drug use including heroin and cocaine increased 52 percent.

Ecstasy is one of the more popular club or “rave” drugs; it’s a stimulant and hallucinogenic derivative of methamphetamine. A Monitoring the Future Study found that 12.7 percent of college students had used Ecstasy at least once in their lives.  These drugs alter mood and enhance sensation, acting as stimulants or uppers, and some as hallucinogens.

Just like the other drugs, however, these drugs carry some heavy short- and long-term side effects and risk factors. Ecstasy is often used to increase pleasure and can lead to risky sexual behavior. Cocaine and heroin are highly addictive and increase heart and blood pressure, putting users at high risk for fatal overdoses. These drugs alter brain chemistry and can bring about severe withdrawal symptoms.

Poly-drug use, or the use of more than one drug at a time, is common among college students, especially at the party or club scene and increases all of the risk factors.


Rise of ‘Study Drugs’ and Prescription Drug Abuse
A growing epidemic on college campuses is the abuse of prescription medications. These medications are easy to obtain, either through a valid prescription or from another student’s prescription. According to a study in the Journal of Addictive Diseases, 62 percent of a group of students with a valid prescription for ADHD medication were diverting it to students without prescriptions.

Using a medication beyond its intended purpose is considered abuse and can be dangerous. The CDC reports that 100 people die in the United States daily from drug overdoses, with a majority of them being prescription drug-related.

The top three substances used by college students in 2016 were alcohol, marijuana and adderall.College students are under constant pressure to perform academically, and many are looking for a boost. Students are often tempted by ADHD drugs like Adderall and Ritalin, which can improve focus and efficiency, acting as a brain boost. According to CNN, 81 percent of students don’t see the danger in illegally using these stimulants as a “study aid,” and 30 percent of college students are estimated to have tried them at least once.

What many students don’t know is how highly addicting these Schedule II substances are. Since these drugs are prescription-based, many fail to see the danger in them. Like cocaine and other stimulant drugs, these “smart drugs” may work in the short-term, but they can cause devastating long-term damage to the brain.

Other prescription drugs commonly abused by college students include narcotic painkillers and central and nervous system depressants. Central nervous system depressants include tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and sleep aids. Valium and Xanax are considered tranquilizers, and they are benzodiazepines which work to relax muscles and ease anxiety. They are among some of the most prescribed medications in the country and highly addictive.

Vicodin and OxyContin are popular opioid pain relievers that abusers often crush and snort to get high.

These narcotics work to depress pain receptors in the brain and create a euphoric feeling. They are fairly easily accessible, inexpensive, and, like other prescription drugs, thought to be safer and not carry the same stigma as illicit drugs since they have a medicinal purpose. These drugs are highly addictive, however, and the CDC reports that three out of four prescription drug overdoses are caused by painkillers.
